              My favorite experience was spending the hackathon sitting together, stressing out over the amount of work we had to do, but still managing to pull through and kick our project's asses.

              The thing I admire most is how dedicated and hard working Shirley is. Everyone works hard at Harvard, but Shirley really takes that to a new level. And the best part is, she can still smile and be happy. While many of us use the amount of work we have as an excuse to be self centered, she never fails to be loving, caring, or thoughtful, and I admire that to no end.

              One of the first times I met Shirley, we were psetting late one night in Eliot dhall, and somehow there was a pencil stuck in the ceiling.  I was trying really hard to get the pencil out of the ceiling by throwing a frisbee at it.  Shirley thought this was funny, so I knew she was a cool person.

              Winning MIT this past year together was a really great way to conclude my collegiate dancing experience. =] We really had fun while dancing, and while we were thinking about technique, it was a comp where I really felt that we were finally dancing together...and that was really great for me. We have come a LONG way in our friendship and partnership, and it is really great to look back on those happy memories. I love dancing with you, I'm going to be terribly sad to see you leave Boston next year. I don't know if I'll ever be able to replace you! Have a happy 21st birthday. ^^

In middle school, we finished each other's sentences, and we talked on the phone every night even though we only lived 2 minutes away from each other; we would have dropped everything for each other. I fully believe that she is the best friend anyone could ask for, and I am so lucky to be call her my best friend. There are too many unforgettable moments that I could name. She is the first person that I would go to with any of my life's joys, problems, heartbreaks, and I know she would give me her full attention in return. We may be hundreds of miles apart and things may have changed with time, but I know I can always count on her.

Since then I got to know her really well through ballroom and I have tons of memories of us sitting (sometimes late in Lamont 'studying') watching ballroom videos and looking for latin dresses online. I have always found it really easy to talk to her and feel like I can tell her anything. Her dancing also inspired me a lot freshman year and definitely contributed to my passion for dance.

              Not sure if this is exactly the "favorite", but definitely the most memorable. I remember the day we sent Shirley to the airport the first time she had to leave for college. She had already gone through security but this was a small airport so I ran up to the edge of the waiting room where we were separated by a pane of glass. Even though we could see each other, sound didn't travel through the glass so we ended up using our phones to communicate. Perhaps we should have felt silly, talking over phones while we were 1 foot away from each other, only to exchange a few terse phrases about the weather and why Eastside was superior to Buchholz. But that conversation meant everything to me. I treasured every word because it was the first time i realized how true the old cheesy "You don't know how much someone means to you until you lose them" saying was. Even though i had known for years that she was going to leave, when the day came i desperately clung to every last second i had with her. I tried not to show it, but i really was going to miss her, even if she was to come back in only half a year. It was only in that moment that I thought back to all the things she did for me when I was younger, like how she always saved chocolate from the parties she went to for me to eat at home, and when she won a stuffed tiger for me at Las vegas. Many small, seemingly inconsequential memories like these surfaced and I truly appreciated them for the first time. Of course, i wasn't going to stop her from leaving or anything, but it really made me realize how much my sister cares for me and how much i care for her. Because of this, I now treasure the remaining moments we spend together when she visits.

She's always willing to take time out of her day to have a real conversation. She's also incredibly smart (I wouldn't have made it through Stat 110 without her!) and motivated and SUCH A SEXY DANCER. WOW. *__*

              One of my many favorite experiences with Shirley was our New Hampshire trip, marking our first anniversary.  During our time in Franconia, we stayed at Hillwinds Lodge, located near a pleasant river and a breathtaking view of plains and woody forests.  We had our anniversary meal at Sugar Hills Inn, a small country inn that served some of the best sausage-stuffed quail and mussel bisque.  We took the tram, explored Mt. Cannon, and went caving at the Lost River.  We even went to Funspot, a 3-story arcade playhouse!  But after the whole trip, I began to realize that I love Shirley not just because we share so many common interests but because no matter how i'm feeling, she can always make me smile and realize the good in life.  =)

              I first knew Shirley as a passionate, awe-inspiring dance partner.  But over the years, I've learned that Shirley cares about absolutely everything.  Despite having incredibly high-achieving ambitions, she never forgets her friends and family.  I admire her work ethic, but even more, I admire her willingness to lead through acts of kindness.  As enthusiastic and expressive as Shirley is, I admire her most for being able to bring out the best in people.  Over the last two years, she's really showed me how I can become a better person.  =]

              <br/><br/>But I will try to come up with specifics: Shirley always does her best to help people even when she's super busy, and she can always help people because she is SO SMART. And knows when to have fun and when to work hard...and is multitalented as an amazing dancer and encouraging + fun person. Basically I want to be Shirley.
